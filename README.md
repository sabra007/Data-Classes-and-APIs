### Introduction
In the first part of this exercise, you will work in groups of 3-4 to create data classes based on public APIs and present your classes and how they were made with your classmates.

#### Part 1: Find Your Public APIs
Once you're in your breakout rooms, pick an API (with no Auth - no API Keys, etc.) from one of the sources below:

Easy
Free APIs - This resource takes the data from the "medium" resource and presents it in an easy-to-navigate interface.

Medium
Public APIs on GitHub - This resource has a handy column that calls out APIs with no API Keys and no Auth.

Hard
Public APIs - This resource has more public API options, but you'll need to determine whether they are no Auth on your own.

#### Part 2: Create Data Classes
Using your chosen Public API, create five data classes for objects returned by those APIs (don't worry about calling the APIs yet).

#### Part 3: Presentation
Present your data classes to the class and make sure to explain how you came up with them.

Introduction
In the first part of this exercise, you found public APIs and created data classes based on the objects returned by your API. Now, you're going to consume those APIs and create instances of your data classes.

#### Part 1: Writing Your Code
Get back in your groups from yesterday. Once in your breakout room, work together to write the code to consume your API, which will create instances of your data classes.

#### Part 2: Questions
Talk through the following questions. Make sure someone is taking notes because you'll present your answers to the class.

Once you had to consume the API, did you have to change your data classes? If so, what did you change?
If there were no changes, were there any issues you encountered while working with the API?
#### Part 3: Presentation
Present your experiences working with data classes with your classmates.
